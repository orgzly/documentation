* Notebooks Sync

You can store your notebooks on Dropbox or sync them with a directory
on your device.

Notebooks are written as plain-text files in [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]] file format.

Synchronization is currently manual -- you have to initiate it
yourself by clicking the /Sync/ button. Button is located in the
navigation drawer.

** Repository Types
*** Dropbox

 You have to specify a directory for storing your notebooks in.

 - Go to /Settings/
 - Click on /Repositories/
 - Click the plus icon and choose /Dropbox/
 - Enter the directory inside Dropbox (without "Dropbox" part)

*** Device (local storage)

 Notebooks can be synced with one or more directories on your device.

 - Go to /Settings/
 - Click on /Repositories/
 - Click the plus icon and choose /Device Storage/
 - Click /Browse/ and select (or create new) directory

** Status Messages

After syncing is done, every notebook will have its sync status
message updated.

*** No change

Notebook is already synced. Nothing to do.

*** Saved to /URL/

Notbook has been successfully synced by being saved to the repository
represented by /URL/.

*** Loaded from /URL/

Notbook has been successfully synced by being loaded from the notebook
represented by /URL/.

*** Notebook has no link and one or more remote notebooks with the same name exist

Orgzly doesn't know which remote notebook to use for syncing.

Each notebook must have a link to a remote notebook. Link is
usually set automatically after the first sync. However, there are
cases when this is not possible, or when the link is removed.

Link can not be created after the first sync if:

- Notebook was created in Orgzly, but there is already a remote
  notebook with the same name in one of the repositories
- Multiple repositories are used and there is a notebook with the same
  name in them

Link is removed when:

- Repository is renamed or deleted

Link can be set manually:

- Open the list of notebooks ("Notebooks")
- Long-click on a notebook
- Click on /Set Link/
- Choose a repository
- Click /Set/

Link is set if you can see the URL next to the small link icon in
notebook's details.

*** Notebook has no link and multiple repositories exist

See [[Notebook has no link and one or more remote notebooks with the same name exist]].

*** Both local and remote notebook have been modified
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Both-local-and-remote-notebook-have-been-modified
:END:

If you modify a notebook in Orgzly and at the same time (before
performing a sync) you modify its linked remote notebook, next sync
will leave the notebook in a conflicted state.

When notebook is not synced due to conflict, you have two options:

- /Force Load/ to import remote notebook and overwrite the local version
- /Force Save/ to export local notebook and overwrite the remote version

These actions are available in notebook's contextual menu:

- Open the list of notebooks ("Notebooks")
- Long-click on a notebook to open the menu

There is currently no other way to resolve a conflict within Orgzly itself.

**** Manually merging the two, conflicting files when using DropBox

When the local and remove notebooks have been modified in a DropBox 
repository you can rename the underlying .org file in DropBox to be
something different then tell Orgzly to sync the files again, which 
will cause Orgzly to create a new file (with the original file name).
You can then use an external tool (such as a diff program) to determine
what changes were made, and which ones you wish to keep.

Be sure to remember that the new file (with the original file name)
is where you want to put your final, merged version of the file.

** Notes for Org mode users

Notebooks are encoded in [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]] file format.

*** Generated Org files

When compared to your original Org files, files generated by Orgzly
might differ in the amount of white space, outlined below. Any other
difference would be considered a serious bug.

- /Tags are separated from title with a single space character./ You
  will lose your tags' indentation, as if you had ~org-tags-column~
  set to ~0~.

- /Unsupported metadata below header is part of note's content./ As
  soon as any unsupported metadata is encountered, lines from that point
  until the next heading are considered part of note's content.  You
  might find an unexpected new line between supported and unsupported
  metadata, because note's content is normally separated from heading
  by a new line.

If any of this is not working for you, please [[Contact][contact]] us.

* Search
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Search
:END:

Search terms are separated with space.
Default operator for joining search terms is /AND/.

Words are searched within notes' /title/, /content/ and /tags/.

** Search operators

|--------------+------------------------------+-------------------------|
| Operator     | Finds notes                  | Examples                |
|--------------+------------------------------+-------------------------|
| ~s.DAY~      | Scheduled for day or earlier | ~s.today~ ~s.1w~        |
| ~d.DAY~      | Deadline on day or earlier   | ~d.tmrw~                |
| ~i.STATE~    | With state                   | ~i.todo~ ~i.next~       |
| ~.i.STATE~   | Without state                | ~.i.done~ ~.i.canceled~ |
| ~b.NOTEBOOK~ | From notebook                | ~b.Work~ ~b.Home~       |
| ~t.TAG~      | With tag                     | ~t.sport~ ~t.project~   |
| ~p.PRIORITY~ | Having priority              | ~p.a~ ~p.c~             |
|--------------+------------------------------+-------------------------|

*DAY* can be ~today~, ~tod~, ~tomorrow~, ~tmrw~, ~tom~ or denoted by:
  - Nd -- N days from today (~1d~, ~5d~, ...)
  - Nw -- N weeks from today (~2w~)
  - Nm -- N months from today (~3m~)
  - Ny -- N years from today (~1y~)

*STATE* is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Case is irrelevant.

*NOTEBOOK* is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

*TAG* is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

*PRIORITY* is a priority starting from ~A~.

** Sorting

Notes are sorted by notebook name then priority. If =s= or =d= are
used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or deadline
time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

| =o.PROPERTY=  | sort by property                 |
| =.o.PROPERTY= | sort by property (reverse order) |

Following properties are supported:

| =b=  =book=  =notebook=        | notebook name  |
| =s=  =sched=  =scheduled=      | scheduled time |
| =d=  =dead=  =deadline=        | deadline time  |
| =p=  =pri=  =prio=  =priority= | priority       |

** Examples

- ~i.todo t.john~ -- Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=

- ~b.Work .i.done~ -- Search in notebook =Work= for notes that are not =DONE=

- ~b.Home buy~ -- Search in notebook =Home= for notes which contain the
  string =buy= in their title, content or any of the tags

- ~s.1d p.a~ -- Search for priority ~A~ notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)

- =s.1d o.book o.pri= -- Search for notes scheduled for tomorrow sorting them by notebook name then priority

- =o.book o.pri o.s= -- Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time

* FAQ
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: FAQ
:END:

** How much does it cost?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Cost
:END:

Orgzly is free.

** Is the source code available?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Source
:END:

Currently, Orgzly is not an open source project.

However, even though there were no plans to ever become one, it is now
going in that direction. Since majority of Orgzly users are Org mode
users or users of other free software, it is the most commonly asked
question. Checking the code from this new perspective and evaluating
potential monetization options are the two main reasons for simply not
uploading the code right now.

Any released code can be expected in [[https://github.com/orgzly][Github repositories]].

** Is there an iOS version?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: iOS
:END:

No, only Android version is available at the moment.

After implementing some of the important features which are still
missing in the current Android version, there is an idea to start
working on either iOS version or a Web application.
