* Orgzly Search

This is a proposal for extending the [[http://www.orgzly.com/help/#Search][current search]] support in [[http://www.orgzly.com][Orgzly]].

Search results, agenda or a specific note must all be accessible using
a query. That way everything can be swipe&click away (drawer) or be
linked to from outside the app (widget).

** Searching
*** Condition

Basic format of a condition is:

=PROPERTY.OPERATOR.VALUE=

Any text can be specified as well (double-quoted if it contains
spaces) and will be searched for anywhere in the note.

**** Property

Following properties are supported:

| =title=    | note's title              |
| =body=     | note's body               |
| =s=        | scheduled time            |
| =d=        | deadline time             |
| =c=        | closed time               |
| =i=        | specific state (is state)  |
| =it=       | state type                |
| =tn=       | note's tag                |
| =t=        | note's and inherited tag  |
| =p=        | priority                  |
| =clocked=  | total clock time          |
| =clocking= | currently clocked task    |
| =clockin=  | clock-in time             |
| =clockout= | clock-out time            |

In addition, any specific note's property can be used. /(There could
be conflicts.)/

**** Operator

Following relational operators are supported:

| =eq= | equal to                 |
| =ne= | not equal to             |
| =lt= | less than                |
| =le= | less than or equal to    |
| =gt= | greater than             |
| =ge= | greater than or equal to |

Operator can be omitted in which case =eq= is assumed. For example,
these two conditions are the same:

- =t.eq.office=
- =t.office=

The exceptions are =s= and =d= properties, for which default operator
is =le=.

**** Value

For time-based properties (=s=, =d=, etc.), you can use values such
as:

| =3d=                      | three days from now   |
| =1w=                      | one week from now     |
| =3m=                      | three months from now |
| =1y=                      | one year from now     |
| =-5d=                     | five days ago         |
| =today=  =tod=            | today's date          |
| =tomorrow=  =tmrw=  =tom= | one day from now      |
| =yesterday=               | one day ago           |
| =now=                     | today's time          |
| =none=  =no=              | value not set         |
| =2015-01-16=              | specific date         |

For searching by state (=i=) any string defined as either =TODO= or
=DONE= state can be used as a value.

When searching by state type (=it=), there are three possible values:

| =done= | notes with one of the =DONE= states |
| =todo= | notes with one of the =TODO= states |
| =none= | notes with no state set             |

When searching by tags (=t= or =tn=) a word containing any character
except for =space= and =:= can be used.

Value for priority searching (=p=) is a character from =a= to =z=.

*** Multiple conditions

Multiple conditions can be specified at the same time. Conditions are
separated with space or a logical operator.

Following logical operators are supported:

- =not=
- =and=
- =or=

=not= has higher precedence than =and= which has higher precedence
then =or=.

Parentheses (=(= =)=) can be used to explicitly denote precedence by
grouping parts of a condition that should be evaluated first.

Property can also be prepended with =-= (with no space in between)
which is equivalent to using =not= before the condition.  For example,
these two conditions are the same:

- =-i.done=
- =not i.done=

If conditions are separated by space, logical =and= is assumed.

*** Helper conditions

| =due= | =s.le.today or d.le.today= |

/More useful helpers?/

*** Examples

- =it.todo -i.wait=             :: Notes with a todo type of state, except =WAIT=
- =i.todo or i.next or i.wait=  :: Notes with either =TODO=, =NEXT= or =WAIT= state set
- =i.next t.errand=             :: =NEXT= notes tagged with =errand=
- =b.Home t.buy=                :: Notes from =Home= notebook tagged with =buy=
- =i.wait=                      :: Notes with =WAIT= state
- =-it.done votes.gt.5=         :: Tasks not done with =votes= property larger then =5=

/More useful examples?/

** Sorting

Notes are sorted by notebook name then priority. If =s= or =d= are
used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or deadline
time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

| =o.PROPERTY=  | sort by property                 |
| =-o.PROPERTY= | sort by property (reverse order) |

Following properties are supported:

| =b=  =book=  =notebook=        | notebook name  |
| =i=  =state=  =todostate=      | state[fn:i]    |
| =s=  =sched=  =scheduled=      | scheduled time |
| =d=  =dead=  =deadline=        | deadline time  |
| =p=  =pri=  =prio=  =priority= | priority       |

[fn:i] In the same order as defined in settings.

*** Examples

- =o.book o.pri=     :: Sort by notebook name then priority
- =o.book o.pri o.s= :: Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- =o.book o.i o.pri= :: Sort by notebook name then state then priority

** Agenda & Grouping

You can display an agenda for a specific period using:

=a.PERIOD=

Period can be for example:

| =-7d=                   | from 7 days ago until today      |
| =-7d.-2d=               | from 7 days ago until 2 days ago |
| =2015-01-01.2015-01-31= | for a specific time period       |

Notes will be grouped by day.

You can change the grouping using:

 =g.GROUP=

Supported groups are:

| =day=  | day  |
| =week= | week |
| =year= | year |
| =tag=  | tag  |

/Does this even make sense?/

/Is "a" just a helper and grouping a separate feature?/
